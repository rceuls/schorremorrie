## Encounters

- Monster: The number and type of creatures.

- Omen: In a dungeon, the monster is coming but the players have one round to prepare or escape.
- Spoor: Recent trace of the monster. It’s in the area nearby, if the players want, they can easily find it.
- Tracks: If the players decide to follow them, roll a D3 on this list to see where they lead.
- Trace: A sign of the monster’s presence in the ecosystem. A good tracker could use these to find tracks. But otherwise only a clue.
