# Cat, Cactus

Desert cat with hallucinogenic quills. A small beast.

Imagine a greenish gray bobcat with quills on its back. It stares at you in a drunken torpor.

HD: 0 <br />
Armor: none <br />
Hit it: normal (15)<br />
Dodge it: normal (15)<br />
Move: fast (20), climb normal (15) <br /> 	 

It is immune to cactus fever. It can smell and see very well, allowing it to operate in the dark without troubles. It is also very sneaky, especially among cacti.

## Attacks (1/round)

*Claws*. The cactus cat makes a melee attack (1D4).

*Quill Spray*. The cactus cat sprays a short cone with quills. Creatures who fail to dodge take damage (1) and must make a save vs poison or be poisoned with cactus fever.

> **Cactus Fever**. Ingested or in wound: Save or be poisoned, save again every 10 minutes to cure. While poisoned, you are a drunken mess: each player names a different emotion and rolls a D20, the referee alters your actions in a dramatic way according to the emotion with the highest roll. Roll a new emotion every 10 minutes.
