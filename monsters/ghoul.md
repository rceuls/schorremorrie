It is immune to poison and exhaustion. It doesnâ€™t need to eat, breathe, sleep (because it is undead). It can be very stealthy, and have a conversation when not starved.

## Attacks (1/round)

*Diseased Claw*. The ghoul makes one melee attack (1D4). On a hit, the target must save or be stunned. It can save again at the end of each of its turns, it is freed after two successes, or catches Ghoul Rabies and stays paralyzed 10 minutes after two failures.

*Feral Bite*. The ghoul makes one melee attack (1D6). Other creatures have advantage on their melee attacks against it until its next turn.

*Rush*. The ghoul attempts to shove a target. On its next turn, it will act first.

> **Ghoul Rabies**. Disease. Save every night to add or remove a cumulative symptom. Symptom: requires to eat 1 extra ration per day. While sick, you can only eat meat. If you die sick, you become a ghoul.
